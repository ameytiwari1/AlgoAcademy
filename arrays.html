        <h1>Arrays - Detailed Information</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>What is an Array?</h2>
        <p>An array is a data structure in programming that allows you to store and manage a collection of elements under a single variable name. Each element in the array is identified by an index, which starts at 0 for the first element.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Array Declaration and Initialization</h2>
        <p>In most programming languages, you can declare and initialize an array as follows:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                // Example in JavaScript
                let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>You can also declare an empty array and add elements later.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Common Array Operations</h2>
        <p>Arrays support various operations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessing elements by index.</li>
            <li>Adding elements to the end of the array.</li>
            <li>Removing elements from the array.</li>
            <li>Finding the length of the array.</li>
            <li>Iterating through the elements using loops.</li>
            <li>Searching for specific values within the array.</li>
            <li>Sorting and filtering elements.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Array Types</h2>
        <p>Depending on the programming language, you may encounter different types of arrays, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One-dimensional arrays</li>
            <li>Multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., 2D arrays)</li>
            <li>Associative arrays or dictionaries</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Arrays are fundamental data structures in programming that allow you to work with collections of data efficiently. Understanding how to declare, manipulate, and access arrays is essential for any programmer.</p>

        <h1>Linked List - Detailed Information</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>What is a Linked List?</h2>
        <p>A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element is a node containing a value and a reference (link) to the next element. The last element usually points to null, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists come in various types, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Advantages of Linked Lists</h2>
        <p>Linked lists offer several advantages, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink easily during runtime.</li>
            <li>Efficient Insertions and Deletions: Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list can be done with a constant time complexity.</li>
            <li>Memory Efficiency: Linked lists can be more memory-efficient than arrays because they don't require contiguous memory allocation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Common Operations on Linked Lists</h2>
        <p>Common operations you can perform on linked lists include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Insertion: Adding elements to the list at a specified position.</li>
            <li>Deletion: Removing elements from the list.</li>
            <li>Traversal: Iterating through the elements of the list.</li>
            <li>Searching: Finding an element with a specific value.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Linked lists are used in a variety of scenarios, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementing other data structures like stacks and queues.</li>
            <li>Undo/Redo functionality in software applications.</li>
            <li>Dynamic memory allocation in languages like C/C++.</li>
            <li>Modeling real-world scenarios like a chain of train cars or a playlist of songs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Queues - Detailed Information</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>What is a Queue?</h2>
        <p>A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is designed to hold a collection of elements, and elements are processed in the order they are added to the queue. Queues are used to manage tasks, jobs, or data that should be processed in a specific order.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Advantages of Queues</h2>
        <p>Queues offer several advantages, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Order Preservation: Queues ensure that elements are processed in the order they are received.</li>
            <li>Task Management: Queues are useful for managing tasks, scheduling, and order-sensitive processing.</li>
            <li>Parallelism: Queues can be used to implement parallel processing and multi-threading scenarios.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Common Operations on Queues</h2>
        <p>Common operations you can perform on queues include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enqueue: Adding elements to the rear of the queue.</li>
            <li>Dequeue: Removing elements from the front of the queue.</li>
            <li>Peek: Viewing the element at the front of the queue without removing it.</li>
            <li>Size: Determining the number of elements in the queue.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Queues are used in various scenarios, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Task scheduling in operating systems and job queues in batch processing systems.</li>
            <li>Print job management in printer queues.</li>
            <li>Data processing pipelines where data is processed in a specific order.</li>
            <li>Messaging systems to handle messages in the order they are received.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Stacks - Detailed Information</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>What is a Stack?</h2>
        <p>A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is designed to hold a collection of elements, and elements are processed in reverse order to how they were added. Stacks are used for various applications, including managing program control flow and function call management.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Advantages of Stacks</h2>
        <p>Stacks offer several advantages, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Order Preservation: Stacks ensure that elements are processed in the reverse order they were added.</li>
            <li>Function Call Management: Stacks are used in programming to manage function calls, allowing for recursion and efficient memory usage.</li>
            <li>Expression Evaluation: Stacks can be used to evaluate expressions in reverse Polish notation (RPN).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Common Operations on Stacks</h2>
        <p>Common operations you can perform on stacks include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Push: Adding elements to the top of the stack.</li>
            <li>Pop: Removing elements from the top of the stack.</li>
            <li>Peek: Viewing the element at the top of the stack without removing it.</li>
            <li>Size: Determining the number of elements in the stack.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Stacks are used in various scenarios, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function call management in programming languages.</li>
            <li>Undo/Redo functionality in software applications.</li>
            <li>Expression evaluation in calculators and compilers.</li>
            <li>Backtracking algorithms and solving problems like the Tower of Hanoi.</li>
